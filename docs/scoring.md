# Scoring Methodology Documentation

This document explains how the AI Model scoring system works.

## **MAJOR UPDATE**: LLM-Generated Scoring
As of the latest update, scores are now **directly generated by the LLM** during the article creation process, rather than being calculated by a heuristic algorithm. This allows for a deeper, semantic understanding of the model's capabilities based on its README.

## 1. Overall Score & Tiers
The Overall Score is a weighted average of three core metrics. Tiers are assigned based on this score.

| Metric | Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quality Score** | 33.3% | Output quality, accuracy, realism |
| **Speed Score** | 33.3% | Inference speed and efficiency |
| **Freedom Score** | 33.4% | Licensing, cost, accessibility |

| Tier | Score Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S** | 90 - 100 | Exceptional |
| **A** | 80 - 89 | Excellent |
| **B** | 70 - 79 | Good |
| **C** | 60 - 69 | Adequate |
| **D** | 0 - 59 | Limited |

## 2. LLM Scoring Instructions
The AI is instructed to assign scores (0-100) based strictly on the README content:

### A. Quality Score (0-100)
*   **Focus**: Accuracy, realism, coherence, benchmarks.
*   **Signals**: Look for state-of-the-art claims, specific benchmark numbers (MMLU, HumanEval, FID), and comparisons to other leading models.
*   **Default**: 60 (if no specific info found).

### B. Speed Score (0-100)
*   **Focus**: Inference speed, latency, efficiency.
*   **Signals**: Words like "turbo", "real-time", "distilled", "quantized", or metrics like tokens/sec.
*   **Default**: 60.

### C. Freedom Score (0-100)
*   **Focus**: Openness, licensing, cost.
*   **Rubric**:
    *   **90+**: Permissive Open Source (MIT, Apache 2.0).
    *   **75**: Semi-restrictive (CC-BY).
    *   **65**: Restrictive (GPL).
    *   **50**: Non-commercial only (CC-BY-NC).
    *   **40**: Unknown / Unspecified.
    *   **Bonus (+10)**: Open Weights / Open Source.
    *   **Penalty (-15)**: Paid / Enterprise / Closed Source.

## 3. Metadata Extraction
The system also extracts specific technical metadata:
*   **Safetensors**: Checks for explicit mention of `.safetensors` format.
*   **Model Size**: Extracts parameter counts (e.g., "7B", "30B").
*   **Tensor Types**: Identifies precisions (e.g., "BF16", "FP32", "INT8").
