## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 Architecture Overview

TopTierModels follows a decoupled architecture optimized for **free-tier deployment** with three primary components:

1. **Backend Pipeline** (Local Python/Node.js scripts)
2. **Database & Storage** (Supabase Free Tier)
3. **Frontend Application** (React/Next.js on Netlify Free Tier)

### Appendix B: Scoring Algorithm

**Overall Score Calculation:**
```
Overall Score = (Performance × 0.30) + 
                (Usability × 0.25) + 
                (Innovation × 0.20) + 
                (Adoption × 0.15) + 
                (Production × 0.10)
```

**Tier Assignment:**
- **S Tier:** 90-100 (Exceptional, industry-leading)
- **A Tier:** 80-89 (Excellent, highly recommended)
- **B Tier:** 70-79 (Good, solid choice)
- **C Tier:** 60-69 (Adequate, situational use)
- **D Tier:** 0-59 (Limited, not recommended)

### 5.3 Free Tier Constraints and Optimizations

#### 5.3.1 Supabase Free Tier Limits

**Database:**
- 500MB database space
- Unlimited API requests
- Paused after 1 week of inactivity
- 2 concurrent connections
- 50MB file uploads limit per file
- 1GB total storage

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Database Size Management**
   - Limit article content to essential text
   - Store only web-optimized images
   - Compress images before upload (WebP format)
   - Archive old content after 6 months
   - Monitor database size weekly

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - Maximum image size: 500KB per file
   - Use WebP format (60-80% smaller than PNG/JPG)
   - Generate thumbnails at 300x300px maximum
   - Limit to 2-3 images per model article
   - Total target: <800MB storage usage

3. **Connection Management**
   - Use connection pooling
   - Close connections after operations
   - Batch database operations
   - Implement retry logic for connection limits

4. **Activity Management**
   - Set up ping service to prevent inactivity pause
   - Use free uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)
   - Schedule weekly automated requests

#### 5.3.2 Netlify Free Tier Optimization

**Build Minutes Conservation:**
- Limit rebuilds to content changes only
- Avoid rebuilds for style/minor tweaks
- Use build hooks selectively
- Target: <10 builds per month

**Bandwidth Management:**
- Serve optimized images (WebP, compressed)
- Implement lazy loading for all images
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Use efficient caching headers
- Target: <50GB bandwidth per month

**Best Practices:**
- Deploy production builds only
- Test locally before deploying
- Use preview deployments sparingly
- Monitor analytics dashboard

### 5.4 Backend Pipeline Execution Strategy

**For Free Tier Deployment:**

**Option 1: Local Manual Execution (Initial Launch)**
- Run scripts on local development machine
- Manual URL input and processing
- Direct upload to Supabase
- No infrastructure costs

**Option 2: GitHub Actions (Free Tier - Recommended for Phase 2)**
- 2,000 minutes per month (free)
- Scheduled weekly runs
- Triggered by repository dispatch
- Automated content generation

**Workflow:**
1. Admin adds URL to `queue.json` in repository
2. Pushes to GitHub
3. GitHub Action triggers pipeline
4. Script processes model, uploads to Supabase
5. Triggers Netlify rebuild via webhook
6. New content appears on site

**GitHub Actions Configuration:**
```yaml
# Example workflow (not code, just specification)
name: Process Model
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger
jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Install dependencies
      - Run scraper script
      - Run LLM processor
      - Upload to Supabase
      - Trigger Netlify build hook
```

### 5.5 Cost Analysis for Free Tier

**Monthly Costs: $0**

| Service | Free Tier Limits | Usage Estimate | Cost |
|---------|------------------|----------------|------|
| Supabase Database | 500MB | 300MB (60 models) | $0 |
| Supabase Storage | 1GB | 800MB (images) | $0 |
| Netlify Hosting | 100GB bandwidth | 40GB | $0 |
| Netlify Builds | 300 minutes | 60 minutes | $0 |
| GitHub Actions | 2,000 minutes | 100 minutes | $0 |
| LLM Processing | Pay-per-use | Local/free tier | $0* |

*Note: LLM costs depend on choice:
- **Local Ollama:** Free, requires local GPU
- **OpenAI Free Tier:** Limited tokens
- **Anthropic Claude:** Pay-per-use (estimate $2-5/month for 20 models)

**Scaling Trigger Points:**
- 100+ models: Upgrade Supabase ($25/month)
- 100K+ monthly visitors: Upgrade Netlify ($19/month)
- Daily builds needed: Consider dedicated CI/CD
