    "readme_content": "⚡️- Image\nAn Efficient Image Generation Foundation Model with Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer\nWelcome to the official repository for the Z-Image（逐相）project!\n✨ Z-Image\nZ-Image is a powerful and highly efficient image generation model with\n6B\nparameters. Currently there are three variants:\n🚀\nZ-Image-Turbo\n— A distilled version of Z-Image that matches or exceeds leading competitors with only\n8 NFEs\n(Number of Function Evaluations). It offers\n⚡️sub-second inference latency⚡️\non enterprise-grade H800 GPUs and fits comfortably within\n16G VRAM consumer devices\n. It excels in photorealistic image generation, bilingual text rendering (English & Chinese), and robust instruction adherence.\n🧱\nZ-Image-Base\n— The non-distilled foundation model. By releasing this checkpoint, we aim to unlock the full potential for community-driven fine-tuning and custom development.\n✏️\nZ-Image-Edit\n— A variant fine-tuned on Z-Image specifically for image editing tasks. It supports creative image-to-image generation with impressive instruction-following capabilities, allowing for precise edits based on natural language prompts.\n🔥 Model Zoo\nModel\nHugging Face\nModelScope\nZ-Image-Turbo\nZ-Image-Base\nTo be released\nTo be released\nZ-Image-Edit\nTo be released\nTo be released\n🖼️ Showcase\n📸\nPhotorealistic Quality\n:\nZ-Image-Turbo\ndelivers strong photorealistic image generation while maintaining excellent aesthetic quality.\n📖\nAccurate Bilingual Text Rendering\n:\nZ-Image-Turbo\nexcels at accurately rendering complex Chinese and English text.\n💡\nPrompt Enhancing & Reasoning\n: Prompt Enhancer empowers the model with reasoning capabilities, enabling it to transcend surface-level descriptions and tap into underlying world knowledge.\n🧠\nCreative Image Editing\n:\nZ-Image-Edit\nshows a strong understanding of bilingual editing instructions, enabling imaginative and flexible image transformations.\n🗝️ Model Architecture\nWe adopt a\nScalable Single-Stream DiT\n(S3-DiT) architecture. In this setup, text, visual semantic tokens, and image VAE tokens are concatenated at the sequence level to serve as a unified input stream, maximizing parameter efficiency compared to dual-stream approaches.\n📈 Performance\nAccording to the Elo-based Human Preference Evaluation (on\nAlibaba AI Arena\n), Z-Image-Turbo shows highly competitive performance against other leading models, while achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source models.\nClick to view the full leaderboard\n🚀 Quick Start\nInstall the latest version of diffusers, use the following command:\nClick here for details for why you need to install diffusers from source\nWe have submitted two pull requests (\n#12703\nand\n#12715\n) to the 🤗 diffusers repository to add support for Z-Image.

This ultimately motivated us to develop an improved distillation process that significantly enhances the performance of few-step generation.\n🤖 DMDR: Fusing DMD with Reinforcement Learning\nBuilding upon the strong foundation of Decoupled-DMD, our 8-step Z-Image model has already demonstrated exceptional capabilities. To achieve further improvements in terms of semantic alignment, aesthetic quality, and structural coherence—while producing images with richer high-frequency details—we present\nDMDR\n.\nOur core insight behind DMDR is that Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) can be synergistically integrated during the post-training of few-step models. We demonstrate that:\nRL Unlocks the Performance of DMD\n🚀\nDMD Effectively Regularizes RL\n⚖️\n⬇ Download\npip install -U huggingface_hub\nHF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1 hf download Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo\n📜 Citation\nIf you find our work useful in your research, please consider citing:\n@article{team2025zimage,\n  title={Z-Image: An Efficient Image Generation Foundation Model with Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer},\n  author={Z-Image Team},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2511.22699},\n  year={2025}\n}\n\n@article{liu2025decoupled,\n  title={Decoupled DMD: CFG Augmentation as the Spear, Distribution Matching as the Shield},\n  author={Dongyang Liu and Peng Gao and David Liu and Ruoyi Du and Zhen Li and Qilong Wu and Xin Jin and Sihan Cao and Shifeng Zhang and Hongsheng Li and Steven Hoi},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2511.22677},\n  year={2025}\n}\n\n@article{jiang2025distribution,\n  title={Distribution Matching Distillation Meets Reinforcement Learning},\n  author={Jiang, Dengyang and Liu, Dongyang and Wang, Zanyi and Wu, Qilong and Jin, Xin and Liu, David and Li, Zhen and Wang, Mengmeng and Gao, Peng and Yang, Harry},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2511.13649},\n  year={2025}\n}",
